The 'SurfsUp' directory encompasses essential components for climate analysis, including the 'climate.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook, the 'app.py' Python script, and a 'Resources' folder housing the 'hawaii.sqlite' database. 
Additionally, within the 'Resources' folder, you'll find 'hawaii_measurements.csv' and 'hawaii_stations.csv,' serving as supplementary datasets for the climate analysis project.

This project leverages Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform comprehensive data exploration and analysis on an SQLite climate database.
The data analysis is conducted through SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) queries, facilitating seamless interaction with the database. 
Additionally, the project incorporates Flask to design an API, allowing users to query the climate data programmatically.
